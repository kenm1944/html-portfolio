<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a licensed master electrician retired. I got serious about learning how to code because I wanted to design an 
   application for electricians that can be installed on their phone (android) for use in the field. 
   This application would help with electrical calculations, conduit fill, sizing service's, motors, etc. There are already
   many applications out there, but I wanted to design something that would be easy to use out in the field and get
   the user an answer quickly.
   I have a little experience with coding. I dabbled with Visual Basic and C++, but decided to use Android Studio with Jetpack Compose and
   Kotlin. I enrolled in these courses given by Udemy, Complete Kotlin development and Kotlin and Android Studio Jetpack Compose.
   Am now in the process of finishing some of these courses up. I also have started to code the application that I want to design, 
   but have a long way to go to completion.

<p>
  As I was learning Jetpack Compose and Kotlin I noticed other courses that interested me. One was this course Complete 2023 Web development 
  bootcamp by Dr. Angela Yu. which I just started and also her Python course, which I have not started. Some other courses I enrolled
  in. Crash Course in Electronics and PCB design, Desktop IT and how to build a computer from scratch. Between coding my app and learning
  from these courses it should keep me occupied for awhile. 
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy learning how to code and learning the different coding languages plus learning from the other courses I enrolled in. 
  I'm in my late 70's but I believe your never too old to learn and should try new things.
  I don't plan to go work for anyone or a company. If I get sufficient at this, will work for myself.
  Will I get my application finished, complete these other courses and actually build a computer from scratch or design a 
  website for somebody I hope so, time will tell.
